# Go Language Learning Repository

Welcome to my Go language learning repository. In this repository, you'll find my journey through learning Go, a statically typed, compiled language designed at Google.

## What is Go?

Go (also referred to as Golang) is an open-source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

## What's in This Repository?

This repository stores code snippets, small programs, and application codes I'm writing while I'm learning Go. They demonstrate the application of various language features and standard library functions available in Go.

## How to Use This Repository?

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate into each individual folder to find the Go source code.
3. Each source file demonstrates a different aspect of the programming language.
4. You can run these files with the Go compiler to see their output and understand how they work.

## Contributing

If you're also a Golang learner and want to contribute, you're more than welcome! Feel free to fork this repo and submit PRs.

Happy coding!
